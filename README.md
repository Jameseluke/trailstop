# Trailing Stop Loss Stock Alert App

A Node app built with NEAN stack (NeDB, Express, Angular, NodeJS)
Allows a user to track any number of stocks, with alerts being sent to a list of emails upon certain criteria being met.

1. If the high price (HP) for the day is more than 20% above the alert price (AP), amend the AP to equal HP-20%.
2. If HP is greater than AP by less than 20%, do nothing.
3. If closing price (CP) is less than AP, send alert to a given email address.
 
Other functionality that is included in the app is thus:

1. The capacity to amend AP at any time manually.
2. The capacity for multiple alert levels (eg. 5%, 10%, 20%) alterable at the user's discretion, whereby the above notification system will operate on the chosen basis.
3. The capacity to add or remove stocks from the list.
